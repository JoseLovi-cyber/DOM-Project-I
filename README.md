DOM stands for 'Document Object Model'
In this DOM-Project I have learnt the following things:
- It allows programs to change the content, style, and structure of a document.
- JavaScript can use the DOM to add, change, or remove HTML elements, attributes, CSS styles, and events.
- I have changed the following things using DOM
- BackgroundColor, Margin, Padding, FontSize, FontWeight, Height, Width and Color
